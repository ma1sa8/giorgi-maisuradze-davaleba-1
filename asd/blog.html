        <p style="width: 30%;">Porsche engineers knew exactly what 
            their objective was: to make the 
            new 911 GT2 RS the most powerful 
            Porsche for the road. 
            Objective achieved. The water cooled six-cylinder bi-turbo Boxer 
            engine with four-valve technology, 
            variable turbine geometry (VTG) 
            and VarioCam Plus delivers its 
            power through the rear axle. From 
            a displacement of 3,600 cm3, it 
            generates an enormous 456 kW 
            (620 hp) at an engine speed of 
            6,500 rpm.The maximum torque 
            of 700 Nm is available from 
            2,250 rpm. From 0 to 100 km/h 
            (62 mph) takes just 3.5 seconds. 
            To 200 km/h (124 mph) only 
            9.8 seconds, and to 300 km/h 
            (186 mph) just 28.9 seconds. 
            Maximum boost pressure is not 
            reached until a speed of 330 km/h 
            (205 mph). The weight-to-power 
            ratio that is essential for this kind 
            of performance is just 2.21 kg/hp. 
            A consistent supply of oil to the 
            engine even at high cornering 
            speeds is achieved using a 
            dry sump lubrication system with a 
            separate engine oil reservoir. The 
            oil is cooled by an oil-water heat 
            exchanger.</p>
